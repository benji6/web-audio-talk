# Web Audio - let there be sound

This talk is going to be a crash course on the Web Audio API. We will cover topics ranging from the nature of sound, through to music theory and electronic audio synthesis. Each step along the way we'll take a smattering of theory with a dose of hard code and be indulged / disturbed by strange new sounds. In addition to these abstract and experimental musings we will consider practical uses from earcons to games and digital audio workstations.

The talk doesn't assume any prior knowledge or experience in these areas and rather than attempting to convey any deep or specialized knowledge the aim is to pique curiosity and give everyone a good overview and some tools to get started on their own auditory adventures.
